        "\n",
        "Ans- Python is a widely used programming language, and its popularity can be attributed to several key features:-\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Readability and Simplicity: Python has a clear and easy-to-read syntax, which makes it accessible for beginners. This simplicity allows programmers to focus on problem-solving rather than the intricacies of syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Versatility: Python is a general-purpose language that can be used for various applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and more. Its versatility enables developers to work across different domains with the same language.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Rich Ecosystem and Libraries: Python boasts a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (like NumPy, Pandas, Django, Flask, TensorFlow, and many others) that simplify the development process and extend its functionality. This extensive collection allows developers to find solutions and tools for almost any problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Open-source Community: Python is open-source, meaning that it is free to use and has a large community of developers who continuously improve it and contribute to its libraries. This collaborative environment fosters innovation and support.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, which makes it easy to develop and deploy applications across different platforms.\n",

        "Ans- Predefined keywords in Python, also known as reserved words, are special words that have predefined meanings in the language syntax.

        "\n",
        "Ans:- In Python, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. The two main types of loops are:\n",
        "\n",
        "For Loops\n",
        "While Loops\n",
        "\n",
        "Each type of loop has its use cases and benefits. Here's a detailed explanation of each, along with examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. For Loops:-\n",
        "The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or any iterable object. It is commonly used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example: Iterating over a list  \n",
        "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]  \n",
        "\n",
        "for fruit in fruits:  \n",
        "    print(fruit)  \n",
        "# Output:  \n",
        "# apple  \n",
        "# banana  \n",
        "# cherry  \n",
        "Use Case:\n",
        "for loops are particularly useful when we need to perform an action for each element in a collection or when we want to repeat an operation a specific number of times.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example with range():\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example: Using range()  \n",

        "# 2  \n",
        "# 3  \n",
        "# 4  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. While Loops:-\n",
        "The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is True. It is useful when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on the condition.\n",

        "# 2  \n",
        "# 3  \n",
        "# 4  \n",
        "Use Case:\n",
        "while loops are suitable when we need to repeat a block of code until a certain condition changes, such as reading user input until a specific value is entered.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example with user input:\n",
        "\n",
